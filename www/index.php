            Iâ€™m a designer, cyclist, and odd dad living in San Luis Obispo, CA. I'm currently working at <a href="https://github.com/nsolerieu">GitHub</a> as a web designer. Before that I was at <a href="https://www.opendoor.com/">Opendoor</a>. Aside of my main gig I've been working with early stage startup, friends, and my own projects. This is my humble website, showcasing a homebrew of, 70% baked (and under), personal and professional projects. All fueled by scrappiness and stubbornness. May you wish to discover what I'm up to, consider exploring the links below.
