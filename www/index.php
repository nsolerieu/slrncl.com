            I’m a designer, cyclist, and odd dad living in San Luis Obispo, CA. I'm currently working at <a href="https://github.com/nsolerieu">GitHub</a> as a web designer. Before that I was at <a href="https://www.opendoor.com/">Opendoor</a> and aside of my main gig I've been working with early stage startup, friends, and my own projects.
