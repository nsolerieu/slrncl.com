      "note":"I like the teenage simplicity of this wallet. I had many fancier, more minimal ones in teh past. This one seems to hold up well to my negligence. I also like th look people give me when they see it - like I'm a sloppy teenager. The ID card window is so american and funny to me, it makes me feel like a pokemon trainer."

Since then I often carry it with me. I guess that what kids call a pet rock. Seeing it reminds me of the concept of Yugen. I feel an odd sense of beauty, even though the beauty doesn’t exist in the literal sense of the word and cannot be seen directly – in other words: beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. I love my rock."

I upgraded my classic flannel grid pattern to nicer japense ones from Kiriko and highly recommend these to all those who have a runny nose or sweaty face. There is too many uses for it to list here. It's also a lovely thing have (and look at) in your pocket, even covered in dry boogers."
