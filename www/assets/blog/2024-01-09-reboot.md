# Reboot

I'm bringing my blog back, properly. It will be closer to a stream of consciousness. Mostly because I refuse to talk to a professional therapist about design system and sidewalk philosophy. Also to relieve my wife a bit.

Like most things I build, I do it for myself. Like they say - the fool who persist in his folly will become wise. Perhaps I'll get there by putting my words out there. It will surely go somewhere. Perhaps that's the zen exercise I need.

Typos and half baked thoughts are my own.
