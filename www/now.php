            I'm barely scraping by between work and familly life. The next couple of month will be emotionally intense and will require me to reduce my workload and learn to chill. I don't know how to have fun, that's fine but my inability to rest is starting to be problem. I'll be using this site as a coping tool and a wayt to feed the soul while not technically be pressured to deliver anything (it doesn't feel like work so far).

            I'm quietly bringing my blog back. It's not in the primary nav yet as I'm figuring out the setup and content. This might take a while to take a decent shape and end up be a bit messy and personal (in a therapeutic way).

            I'm trying to stop being a compulsive doodler. I blame the ipad. When I make something decent, I sometimes post it <a href="https://folio.procreate.com/slrncl">Here</a>.
