            I'm barely scraping by between work and familly life. The next couple of month will be emotionally intense and will require me to reduce my workload and learn to chill. I don't know how to have fun, that's fine but my inability to rest is starting to be problem. I'll be using this site as a coping tool and a wayt to feed the soul while not technically be pressured to deliver anything (it doesn't feel like work so far).

          <p class="medium-margin-top text-color-secondary">
            I'm having alot of fun jamming and posting. That's my only current side project and it feels great. So far it's relatively silly. First assessment is coming.

          <p class="medium-margin-top text-color-secondary">
            I'm re-assessing my relationship with dribbble, read.cv, layer.to. I like contributing to the design community but the anxiety and weirdness of it feels like it's just another shade of social media...

            I'm trying to stop being a compulsive doodler. I blame the ipad. When I make something decent, I sometimes post it <a href="https://folio.procreate.com/slrncl">Here</a>.
