            I'm barely scraping by between work and familly life. The next couple of month will be emotionally intense and will require me to reduce my workload and learn to chill. I don't know how to have fun, that's fine but my inability to rest is starting to be problem. I'll be using this site as a coping tool and a wayt to feed the soul while not technically be pressured to deliver anything (it doesn't feel like work so far).

          <p class="medium-margin-top text-color-secondary">
            My blog is back. This might take a while to take a decent shape and end up be a bit messy and personal (in a therapeutic way).

            I'm trying to stop being a compulsive doodler. I blame the ipad. When I make something decent, I sometimes post it <a href="https://folio.procreate.com/slrncl">Here</a>.
