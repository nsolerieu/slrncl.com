            We finally made it to San Luis Obispo. The busyness of the move is tapering off allowing opportunities for moments of peace. Get out around the lake. Doing less and enjoying more. I'm still a monkey with a tech job and a growing family. The house is a bit empty, we don't know anyone around, still no car. Few things to figure out.

            These days most of my productive design time goes to GitHub. The rest of my limited availability is occasionally invested in shorter (cherry picked) engagements. If my stuff resonates with you and you have ideas, feel free to <a href="index#links">reach out</a>.

            I've been struggling with becoming a dad. Fatigue is getting the best of me and I can't put on any weight or really pay my sleep debt at the moment. This transition is pushing me to acknowledge the "qualitative" aspect of life. At the heart of all the books, anecdotes or conversation on the matter, the good life seems to be a sort of dynamic contemplation with moments of deep appreciation.

          <h2 class="text-color-primary large-margin-top">blogging?</h2>
          <p class="small-margin-top text-regular text-color-secondary">
            I'm quietly bringing my blog back. It's not in the primary nav yet as I'm figuring out the setup and content. This might take a while to take a decent shape and end up be a bit messy and personal (in a therapeutic way).

          <h2 class="text-color-primary large-margin-top">Making a (video) reel</h2>
          <p class="small-margin-top text-regular text-color-secondary">
            Unsure when I'll have time for this but I'd love to compile a nice reel for my homepage. Maybe it's an ego this that will or should go away. Anyway, it's on my list.

            I'm trying to stop being a compulsive doodler. I blame the ipad. When I make something decent, I sometimes post it <a href="https://folio.procreate.com/slrncl">Here</a>.
