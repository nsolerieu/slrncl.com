            I'm about to go on a second parental leave. One that I will finally use properly. I will not do ANY work until Feb 2025.

          <h2 class="large-margin-top">Planning</h2>
          <p class="small-margin-top text-color-secondary">
            I'm increasingly convinced I won't last much longer in big tech. I've only ever been a web designer, I like it and can't seriously think of anything else I would do. Especially when paying a mortgage in California. I don't have and don't want a great big plan but I'll be engaging in something I don't usually do: planning. I'm unsure what it means yet but I must have a greater sense of purpose than "keep going" when I get back to work next year.

            Posting random stories on my blog has been fun and revealing. The comedic relief is worth the time but the content looks a bit dubious. Some positive connections and feeback came out of it. It seems to be one of these things I instantly feel silly for but it will likely be an acceptable memory in the long run. I'm in a weird moment of life.

            It has been a few months. Some good, some bad. That's the kind of experience that makes me feel emotionally older. It stings harder. I have more range and resilience. I'll likely stick with it as long as I can or he wants it. I'm in bed at 8:30, some days I hate it, most days I'm indifferent. He almost broke my nose once. It has to go somewhere.

          <p class="small-margin-top text-color-secondary">
            I'm (still) all over the place feeding the feeds, even in my low-social media ecosystem. Low, not no... dribbble, read.cv, layers.to, behance still tickles me, on top of all the dozen ideas that pop up every day. So instead of posting our there, I'll try to create a personal outlet in the form of a gallery/folder as I did for my photography with the <a href="https://slrncl.com/moments/">/moments</a> page.
