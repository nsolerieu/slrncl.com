# Shortcuts

Time, energy, and resources are limited for all of us. 

Putting most of these toward productivity will distract from foundational stuff like eating and sleeping well. Surely the world needs our contribution, but to what extent? 

Lots of AI tools boast low cost and dramatic time gain.

Taking what seems like a shortcut will inevitably nudge toward a loss of creative autonomy. Losing some is okay when the gain is offsetting, and it’s an intentional and measured act. Even if the tool for maximum cognitive output existed, it would lead to a race to the bottom. A race already ongoing, illustrated by the commoditization of creative work.

I spent years learning how to make more stuff. Higher fidelity, greater output volume, promote more stuff, build faster… and of course, this is not a viable long-term trajectory. The world goes on, and everyone leaves the race at some point. New tools, trends, and generations will come.

One’s knowledge will always be partial.

Being at peace with this is what makes a mature designer. Finding the words –talking it out– being a living voice is the work.

Difficulty is a prerequisite to fulfillment. The finest outcomes come from some form of restraint, voluntary or involuntary — An answer as interesting as it is vague. I like a good trauma-bonding chat. I get a lot more creative juice out of it than through the many newsletters I’m trying to keep up with.

It’s when seeking clarity that one often realizes how vague everything is. That’s what makes ambiguity so precious and painful. It is the inherent condition we all bathe in. The one we need to question by tweaking and trying stuff.

>Believe those who seek the truth, doubt those who find it. — André Gide

There is no truth about the creative process.

No shortcuts.

Only a living voice.
