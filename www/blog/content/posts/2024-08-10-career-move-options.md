# Career move options

A list of all the career move options (not goals)

## 1. Change of landscape
Jump ship! Same job. Different people. Different place. Different industry. Maybe the grass is greener on the other side.

## 2. Seize an opportunity
An unplanned move is a way to make an enthusiastic transition. A perfect team or job opening can pop into your inbox anytime. Serendipity happens.

## 3. Join more mature
Step up your game or seek mentorship by joining a company at a later stage than your current one. Just make sure you define and verify the "maturity". Bigger doesn't mean better. What you gain in support comes at the cost of ease and autonomy.

## 4. Join less mature
Bring your expertise to a younger team to test your knowledge. It’s an opportunity to do things differently while the company goes through familiar stages. It’s like going on vacation in the same spot. Same challenges, new you.

## 5. Internal transfer
No need to necessarily jump ship to get a new job title. It seems rare and awkward to navigate in certain cases (aka - I don't like MY manager but the other team seems chill)

## 6. Do something else
It's hard for me to imagine doing the same thing my whole life. Learning something new or learning by doing can lead to positive change and infuse new enthusiasm for work.

## 8. Do your own thing
Going independent can take many shapes but stems from the same desire: be your own boss and have control over 8 more hours of your day. The counterweight is always income stability and benefits.

## 9. Downshifting
Going part-time or down the ladder are ways to slow down. A viable option when dealing with burnout, life transitions, or diminishing motivation/interest.

## 10. Taking a break
Although few have the resources to take a legit sabbatical break, it is an option often brought up and too rarely fulfilled. From personal experience, it seems like everyone at least a decade into their career says they want or need a break.
