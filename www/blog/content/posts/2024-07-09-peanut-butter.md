# Peanut butter

As a 90s European kid, I didn’t grow up with peanut butter.

Peanuts originated in South America and weren't widely available in Europe until the 20th century. European cuisine has its own traditions and flavors, peanut butter simply wasn’t a staple like it has in the US.

I had my first taste of peanut butter at the age of 29, and I absolutely love it. It's rare to experience something so common for the first time in adulthood.

PB embodies america. It's new (to me), tasty, abundant, and polarizing. 
The only problem with it is that it’s delicious.

PB illustrate the cosco dilemma. It's mass-produced, so cheap.
The way it is sold incentivizes a bad relationship with it. 
Large jars could technically last longer but that's not how cravings work.

Nowadays I overpay for the fancy PB sold in a small jar.<br>
This is how I deal with being a consumer in America.
