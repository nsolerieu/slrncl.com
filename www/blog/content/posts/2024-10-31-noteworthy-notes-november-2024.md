# Noteworthy notes - November 2024

Introducing a new format. I’ll keep it loose to form a monthly stream-of-consciousness vibe. I objectively spend too much time thinking if something is worth a blog post. Hopefully, this format will allow silly observations to coexist alongside other comments without turning into senseless mush.

I’ve been thinking about the WordPress controversy. I initially empathized more with WordPress and its core open-source ethos. I never contributed but definitely benefited. I have to confess agreeing with the general criticism of Matt M after reading a few posts. I don’t use WordPress anymore but emphasize with the general sentiment of hypocrisy and aggressive defense of the golden egg. I left it at that until I read Nilay’s post where he compared the American democracy to a very large open-source project. He centers his piece around the crucial need to consider collective action problems. Word choice aside, this is what Matt is getting at (I think). If words and dollars are most important, there are more contentious tech billionaires than Matt Mullenweg at the moment. WordPress appears similar to the Democratic Party, pushing a progressive agenda but not in the most pleasing manner (because there isn’t a universally pleasant way to do anything at that scale). WP engine is an example of liberal capitalism the Republicans love so much. I’m not an American citizen. I can’t vote. I’d be extremely convinced by the democratic model, however imperfect, to keep pushing instead of letting the invisible hand of the market play the cards. The hands are not invisible. We all know where the money is. On both sides. Also, I’d love for my kids to not get shot or end up driving an Uber.

All the AI products advertising how smart and helpful they are remind me of my wife. Having a companion smarter than you is great conceptually but not necessarily enjoyable. Tech nag is a real pain and getting so much worse year after year. We are married to our phones, and they are getting more demanding of our attentions. More seriously, when the UI gets smarter than the user, expect friction.

At the park, my kid stole 2 baseballs from a group playing, they didn’t notice him. I had to  ask seriously a very intense-looking guy: “Is that your balls?” 

---
The first month postpartum prophecy is happening again. Everyone is stuffing us with food. That’s very charitable but the lack of sleep makes this a horrible combo. I joined the lemon juice + baking soda gang, that helps, especially after dinner. 

---
I gave another go to compression underwear and it’s doing something positive. Mild, but positive. Same with insoles.

---
Keeping things unorganized has worked out for me so far. Not because I’m surrounded by organized people nor because I’m particularly lucky (it's been a recurring inquiry I can confidently say - no). Being selective about what one collects matters more to me than the categorization.

---
How long can one go without relieving a bit of an emotional itch? Is the dissonance of brute force discipline backfiring in some way? I think so. Surely all impulses need not to be considered in such ways but the nurturing ones likely should.

---
I remembered an interview of Yvon Chouinard somewhere stating that he refused to think of fitness beyond the simple motto: You are what you do. He was explaining how he used to be a fit young climber spending his days out and now he is a fat businessman, and how that all made too much sense, no need to be a doctor. It’s one of these oversimplifications that allows for a quick grasp which I like to use when I catch myself go down the overthinking route. I’m an overstimulated dad who has been doing a lot of cardio for a decade. I’m stiff and cranky, that makes sense.

The indie web is a fun bunch. It’s also quite big by now. It has its own tools and conventions, lots of them. I like the general ethos compared to big tech but the sheer scale is starting to feel beyond “indie”. The length at which some go to torture their setup to do all the things in The indie way is quite ridiculous. I’ve been reading a bunch of blogs. I’m equally fascinated by the diversity of perspectives than frustrated by certain. The novelty is fading. If one reads enough blogs I speculate that the same overload and anxiety as traditional media/social media would ensue.

Moisturizing even using the most basic product is much better than doing nothing. Putting in a lot more effort and resources only yields and very small improvement. The same applies to drinking water, eating vegetables, brushing teeth...  I need to make a list of all these types of things.

Creativity being sustenance would explain a lot of my awful feelings. It unfortunately doesn’t offer a solution. Creation as purpose stands somehow in contrast to the “let it go” zen philosophy I've been trying to adopt - although Zen includes and encourages artistic expression. To make or to make with moderation aren't that far.

There’s someone out there I could help in theory, if the goal was just to achieve the outcome they want. But I know that the process would be very difficult for them (and likely me too) and so it’s not worth extending my hand. It’s frustrating, but process matters.

I received so many emails asking for help redesigning their website since going on leave. I could help if the goal was just to achieve the outcome they described in their initial email. But I know the reality will bend this into a shape I can no longer accommodate. Every year passing requires me to say no more often. It's frustrating but now vital.

The first month postpartum got me remembering that scene from Mr and Mrs Smith where Brad Pitt is talking to the therapist and says: “don’t get me wrong, I love my wife, but sometimes…”

---
The temperature dropped 20+ degrees Fahrenheit in the span of a day. I'n new to the area so it might be normal. It felt wild.

I tried to politely chicken out of anything Halloween-related by saying that my 2-year-old was too young g as he doesn’t talk, understand, or tolerate much. Someone said verbatim: “Nah you just got to push the fun on them”. How American is this?

---
I hated the taste of alcohol long before A drew Uberman (finally) declared that it’s bad for humans. Unfortunately, that makes me sound like a Huberman fanboy today. It’s equally silly how dry red wine is getting such good PR from this.

---
80% of my Apple Watch usage is seeing incoming calls from wife my and text notifications to answer on my phone. The rest is just my fumbling with it and workouts. Definitely big HR accuracy concerns, especially on the stationary bike. If I keep my arms up at the same cadence, HR goes up 15 beats. OCD about zone 2 and sleep tracking have flared back up, as expected.

I felt like a giant hypocrite 2sec after telling my son who tripped and fell: “slow down, you’ll mess up again by going too fast even on smooth terrain”
